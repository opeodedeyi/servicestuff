JUST SOME THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THE CODE

1. all the code for the project is inside the html.

2. always check the media querry at the bottom of the page for code for each element you copy.

3. for the posotioning of the footer of the page at the bottom of the screen, copy the two opening div tags 
that starts just on top of the header tags and closes just under the section tag. its Css will be found in 
the general styling of the page from line 12-32.

4. all the overlays except the loading overlay will be found in the index.html file from line 43-595. the loading 
overlay will be found in the uploadproject.html from line 23-34.

5. for upload project and upload skill profile, note that the title is to have a maximum character of 50 characters.
and the description to have 500-600 characters. i dont know how, but the tags might give you issues and you might 
need to change it. its css is commented "POST PROJECT FORM STYLING" 
and also copy "input styling for post project, skill and profile page"

6. to edit someones profile page (full name, email address, e.t.c.), go to myProfile.html

7. for search result, go to searchResult.html. i set the default overlay to bloc so it will always show. remember all 
the overlays can be found at the beginning of the css.

8. post page shows when a user clicks on post button, it takes them to the page where they select between post a skilled 
profile or to post a project.

9. uploadProject.html and uploadSkill.html are the two html files for uploading a project and skilled profile respectively. 
remember that the dropzone will be required for only the uploadProject.html as we can handle that for now.

10. all the modals have javascript code in the app.js, nav bar, tags and upload profile photo have jquery code in the app.js also.
